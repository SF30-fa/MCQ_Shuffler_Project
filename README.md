##MCQ Shuffler Project
This file contains MCQ_input_File and MCQ_Output_File, which are a demo of my MCQ shuffler program. 

##What it does
As the project's name shows, the user need a text file containing a list of Multiple Choice Questions.
The user will first need to enter the number of shuffled versions they wish to get,
then they will need to enter the directory path of the initial MCQ version's text file into the program, 
along with the directory path of where they want the different shuffled versions to be generated in.
After a few seconds, you should see all of the shuffled versions of your MCQ text file in the directory path you entered.

##What if my test isn't in a text file?
You can open the NotePad++ app, the TextEdit app, or whatever software that is on your device to create a simple text file,
just copy the questions, paste them in, and save the text file onto your device. It is way easier than it seems!

##IMPORTANT
Each question must be formatted with a number at the beginning, and 4 possible answer choices: A, B, C, and D.
You must have the questions in ascending order of number (so from 1 to 20 for example).
You must also use one of these two formats for each question:

1. What is the capital of France?        |     1- Who is the Football/soccer player with the most Ballon d'Or trophies?
   A. Berlin                             |        A. Lionel Messi
   B. London                             |        B. Cristiano Ronaldo
   C. Paris                              |        C. Diego Maradona
   D. Rome                               |        D. Sergio Ramos


##Demo
I took 50 microeconomics MCQ questions,pasted them in the default version text file, 
and then gave it to the program while asking it for 4 versions. 

Final product: 4 different ordered version, the program does exactly what it is conceived to do!

You can see the output files of the 4 different versions in the folder.

Here are some pictures illustrating the DEMO:

Directory path, you must add the name of the file at the end, and the name of the text file so in my case it went: 
/Users/saeedfakhouri/Desktop/ MCQ_Shuffler_Project-BackEnd/MCQ_input_File/MCQdefaultVersion.txt


<img width="277" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/639eec02-9186-45b7-bb6f-60e4f8132240" />
This is the file I want the program to put the generated shuffled versions in, so I take its directory path, for me it was:
/Users/saeedfakhouri/Desktop/MCQ_Shuffler_Project-BackEnd/MCQ_output_Files


<img width="410" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/347b9f3a-968a-4098-bd5f-05bf884bad0a" />
As you can see here, I asked the program for 4 versions, and gave it the directory paths it needed


<img width="278" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14456037-4884-4966-94c3-6d2dc43b113d" />
Final product: All versions are in the output directory path


<img width="388" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/905a4288-d13a-4dc0-b1a7-f2ece8039819" />
Here as you can see the different versions contain the same questions as the initial version, but in a shuffled manner



##Thank you for using the MCQ Shuffler Program!
