This file contains MCQ_input_File and MCQ_Output_File, which are a demo of my MCQ shuffler program. 
I took 50 microeconomics MCQ questions,pasted them in the default version text file, 
and then gave it to the program while asking it for 4 versions. 

Final product: 4 different ordered version, the program does exactly what it is conceived to do!

I am actively learning Springboot in order to make this program into the backend of a website, which will make the process of entering the input text file 
containing the default version way easier, as well as the receiving of the output files.
